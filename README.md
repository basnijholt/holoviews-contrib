# HoloViews User Contributions

This repository is designed to allow [HoloViews](holoviews.org) users to
share tips, tricks and notebooks as easily as possible.

To browse user submitted content, please visit:

* Our [index of static content](https://github.com/ioam/holoviews-contrib/blob/master/index.md): Anything that can be viewed without a live Python server
* Our [live index on mybinder.org](http://mybinder.org/repo/ioam/holoviews-contrib): Examples that require a running Python process, such as dynamically generated content

You can also view the static index of available live notebooks [directly on GitHub](https://github.com/ioam/holoviews-contrib/blob/master/index.ipynb). If you discover any content that isn't working with the latest HoloViews version, please
[report it here](https://github.com/ioam/holoviews-contrib/issues/4).

## Contributing

To keep things simple, we aim to minimize the necessary curation of user
contributions. The scripts and notebooks in this repository are intended to work with
the latest version of HoloViews and if we find content that no longer works and that
cannot be easily fixed, we will archive it by moving it to the archive
subdirectory. For our contribution guidelines, see
[CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/ioam/holoviews-contrib/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).

## mybinder.org

To run notebooks live, we are using the generous free service offered by
[mybinder.org](http://mybinder.org/). At the time of writing, this is the only free
service that we know of capable of running live notebooks, and so you may notice
lower performance than if you were to run the notebooks on your own machine.
We hope to support other free alternatives as they become available. If you notice
that mybinder isn't reflecting the latest state of this repository, please visit
[mybinder.org](http://mybinder.org/) and submit
``https://github.com/ioam/holoviews-contrib`` to the 'Build a repository' button.
