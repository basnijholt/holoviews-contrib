# HoloViews User Contributions

This repository is to allow [HoloViews](holoviews.org) users to share
tips, tricks and notebooks as easily as possible.

Anyone is free to contribute to our [User
Wiki](https://github.com/ioam/holoviews-contrib/wiki) and we welcome all
PRs in the form of Jupyter notebooks and Python scripts. Our aim is to
make it as easy as possible for anyone to contribute and you can find
out more on our [How to contribute wiki
page](https://github.com/ioam/holoviews-contrib/wiki/How%20to%20contribute).

To keep things simple, we aim to minimize the necessary curation of user
contributions. The scripts and notebooks in this repository are intended
to work with the latest version of HoloViews and if we find content that
no longer works and that cannot be easily fixed, we will archive it by
moving it to the archive subdirectory.
