# Quickstart guides

This subdirectory is intended to hold user-contributed quickstart
guides. A quickstart notebook is one that addresses a particular topic
while assuming minimal prior knowledge and without delving into any
unnecessary detail.

The intention of a quickstart guide is to quickly demonstrate a
particular feature using HoloViews, starting from scratch using examples
that can be understood by an audience unfamiliar with HoloViews. Instead
of explaining a feature in detail, a quickstart guide can link to the
official documentation or other quickstart notebooks in this directory.
