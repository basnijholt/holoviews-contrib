Rendering will be dynamic but memory consumption will remain the same, so you may run out of memory with large ``HoloMap`` objects.  All ``HoloMap`` normalization options remain available, including ``-framewise`` (normalizing across all the elements of the HoloMap is possible as they all exist in Python's memory at once).\n",
    "* Use ``Dynamic`` when building memory-efficient processing pipelines and require a ``HoloMap`` as input. This is useful when working in a notebook that emphasizes the use of ``DynamicMap``. Using ``DynamicMap`` objects can be even more memory efficient than ``Dynamic`` if it is possible to generate the data dynamically, but you may still need to interface with ``HoloMaps`` using ``Dynamic``. You will lose the ``-framewise`` normalization option, because only the elements already displayed can be normalized - most elements will not be in Python's memory (except for the elements that happen to be kept in the ``DynamicMap`` cache). Note that ``Dynamic`` may also be useful for building interactive applications based on the ``DynamicMap`` stream system."

Using Bokeh as a plotting backend, you can use dynamic rendering using ``DynamicMaps`` together with streams to enable direct interaction with your visualizations."
