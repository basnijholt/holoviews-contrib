# Contribution Guidelines

We wish to make it easy to contribute! If you submit a PR following these simple
guidelines, we hope to merge quickly and with minimal review.

**Q**: How do I contribute?

**A**: Please submit a pull request by adapting the notebooks/template.ipynb or
     scripts/template.py files respectively. These files outline the appropriate
     format for contributions.

**Q**: Do I have to clear the output from my notebook before submitting a pull request?

**A**: If your notebook is under 4MB we are always happy to include it and notebooks up
     to 5MB in size will be considered. If you submit a notebook containing output,
     please make sure to add a corresponding nbviewer link to the root index.md file.

**Q**: Can my notebook become part of the official HoloViews documentation?

**A**: Absolutely! If you have a completed notebook that you think would be useful
     documentation to all HoloViews users, please submit a PR at our main repository.
